      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm a MIMS student at UC Berkeley, class of '27. In my spare time I love to run and play video games.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>The projects listed here are previous coursework from my undergrad education. One of my professional goals is to work on more personal projects that are still 
        worth putting on my portfolio.</p>

        <h3>Project 1: Build Your Own World</h3>
        <p>The final project of CS 61B was to build a game world that used the player's keyboard inputs and translated it into commands to navigate around the game map. 
          The world was also randomly generated upon each run, and featured a line of sight mechanic, where vision was restricted to a cone of the map directly in front of the 
        player's head.</p>

        <h3>Project 2: Steam Recommendations</h3>
        <p>For Data 144's final project, we simulated the recommendation system of the Steam platform, a digital storefront for video games, via k-means clustering.
          The system took the title of a game as input, then returned games that were considered to be similar based on the clustering.

        <h3>Project 3: CDI Asthma Analysis</h3>
        <p>For the final project of Data 102, we investigated trends in asthma-related causes of hospitalization and asthma mortality rates, through the lens of causal
          inference and multiple hypothesis testing.
